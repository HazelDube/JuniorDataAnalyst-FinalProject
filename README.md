# Overview

As the first step in analysing a new database, we will first take time to understand the data and schema, identifying relationships that may be interesting. At the end of this preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis, we will discuss our findings and decide which questions deserve further investigation. Each of us will create a Power BI Report to tackle a single question, which will then be consolidated into a Power BI Dashboard to highlight key takeaways and suggestions for improvement. These key takeaways will be reinforced during our presentation of the report to key stakeholders.

# Plan of action

# Q1.

Perform a sentiment analysis on the comments left during reviews, and compare this sentiment statistic to various other factors to explore relationships.

Applied the sentiment analysis on the review comments 
Evaluate the score sentiment and classified in negative, neutral and positive  
Evaluate the distribution of scores per sentiment levels

# Q7.
Use the geographic data available in the dataset to determine which of Brazilâ€™s states has the highest and lowest average review score, and also how the distance between the customer and the seller affects review score.

# Findings and recommendations
Customers rate closer sellers higher, so Olist should recruit sellers from all around the country to increase customer satisfaction
A further investigation may be warranted into North-East states, to see why they have lower scores

Delivery efficiency has a strong impact on the review score left by customers (scores drop immediately if parcel not received by predicted day)
Achievable goal of score increase from 4.09 to 4.25 
Expanding distribution network, improving supply chain processes, using new transport technology

Installmental payments generate more revenue than full- payments as interval charges ( mostly  monthly charge) increase the amount paid n the long run. 
An increase in Voucher payments might increase the revenue of Olist store as it gives the clients more flexibility.

Build brand awareness - It impacts sales and repeat purchases. The more people know and trust the brand name, the higher the sales will grow e.g the other states that have less orders. Plans could be made to do marketing campaigns, invest in search engine optimization
Focus on existing customers - the chances of selling to existing customers is 60-70% compared to a 5-20% probability of a sale with a new customer. This could involve promotions, loyalty cards or discounts .
