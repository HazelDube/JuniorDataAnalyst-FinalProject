# Project

Olist Store is the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. The Brazilian eCommerce public dataset of orders (from 2016 to 2018) made at Olist Store has been provided to your company for analysis.


# Overview - Analysing Olist Store Brazillian Dataset

As the first step in analysing a new database, we will first take time to understand the data and schema, identifying relationships that may be interesting. At the end of this preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis, we will discuss our findings and decide which questions deserve further investigation. Each of us will create a Power BI Report to tackle a single question, which will then be consolidated into a Power BI Dashboard to highlight key takeaways and suggestions for improvement. These key takeaways will be reinforced during our presentation of the report to key stakeholders.

# Plan of action
1.Perform a sentiment analysis on the comments left during reviews, and compare this sentiment statistic to various other factors to explore relationships. 

2.Focus on the sentiment statistic, categorising into Positive, Neutral, and Negative reviews, and relating this to other factors in the dataset. She aims to identify the key influencers that are driving positive and negative reviews.

3.Examine the relationship between reviews that did not leave a comment and reviews that did. She will also investigate the relationship between delivery time and review sentiment.

4.Investigate the sales data and determine which cities produce the highest sales numbers, as well as explore the predictive potential of the collected data.

5.Investigate the effect that payment method has on the amount spent. He will determine which method of payment produces the highest profit for the company, and how this is affected by the number of instalments a customer chooses to pay.

6.Ivestigate the relationship between review score and delivery time, in particular how delivery ahead of the predicted delivery date affects review score.

7.Use the geographic data available in the dataset to determine which of Brazilâ€™s states has the highest and lowest average review score, and also how the distance between the customer and the seller affects review score.
