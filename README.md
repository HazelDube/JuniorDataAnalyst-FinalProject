# Overview

As the first step in analysing a new database, we will first take time to understand the data and schema, identifying relationships that may be interesting. At the end of this preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis, we will discuss our findings and decide which questions deserve further investigation. Each of us will create a Power BI Report to tackle a single question, which will then be consolidated into a Power BI Dashboard to highlight key takeaways and suggestions for improvement. These key takeaways will be reinforced during our presentation of the report to key stakeholders.

# Plan of action
